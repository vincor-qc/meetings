# 2021-04-01

Firstly, please vote on the poll in the announcements channel, we want to hear your feedback on what topics we should cover!

Until we see that a majority of people have voted on the poll, we'll be doing CCC questions. We will start with J3s and J4s and move on to doing J5s as time pass. Of course, if the poll shows that y'all want to do a topic other than CCC (i.e. game development) we'll switch to that whenever we can.

In this meeting, we will be doing two questions - CCC 2016 J3 and CCC 2018 J3. You can see the problem statements at these links:

-   https://github.com/SWC-Python-Club/meetings/blob/main/meetings/2021-04-01/CCC-2016-J3.md
-   https://github.com/SWC-Python-Club/meetings/blob/main/meetings/2021-04-01/CCC-2018-J3.md

Let's start with CCC 2016 J3 - Hidden Palindrome.

## CCC 2016 J3 - Hidden Palindrome

Please read the problem statement on your own first.

[pause]

In short, this question asks us to find the longest substring contained in the input string that is a _palindrome_. We then print the length of this substring to standard output. For example, in the string `hello_mom`, we would print `3` as that is the length of `mom`, the longest palindrome.

**Determining whether a string is a palindrome**<br>
There are a few ways we can go about solving the problem but they all have one thing in common - we need to know how to determine whether a string is a palindrome. Again, there are a few ways to go about this, but we'll be using the simplest one here.

First, Recall that a palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward. Therefore, we can determine whether a string is a palindrome by checking whether reversing the string results in the same string.

A simple way of reversing a string in Python is:

```python
reversed_string = string[::-1]
```

> This utilizes Python's slice notation to create a reversed copy of the string. For more information on this, you can check out the following blog post: https://railsware.com/blog/python-for-machine-learning-indexing-and-slicing-for-lists-tuples-strings-and-other-sequential-types/.

Now, with this code, we can define a function that determines whether a string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
	reversed_string = string[::-1]
	return string == reversed_string
```

And now let's try it out:

```py
>>> is_palindrome("hello")
False
>>> is_palindrome("mom")
True
>>> is_palindrome("a")
True
```

> For the last example, note that a word with one letter is still a palindrome, per the problem statement.

Cool, looks like it works. Now, let's use this to solve the problem.

**Solution**<br>
At the start of the code, let us paste the function we wrote earlier that determines whether a string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
	reversed_string = string[::-1]
	return string == reversed_string
```

Next, let us read the next line of input and store it in a variable:

```python
text = input()
```

Next, let us create a variable that holds the length of the longest palindrome we have found so far:

```python
longest_len = 0
```

Next, let us iterate over all indices of the string:

```python
for start_index in range(0, len(text)):
	pass
```

Next, let us iterate over all possible palindromes that start at this index. To do this, we can iterate from `the index of the last character + 1` down to `start_index`, and then slice the string.

For example, given the input string `abcde` and assuming `start_index` is `0`, `substr` would be one of the following:

-   `abcde`
-   `abcd`
-   `abc`
-   `ab`
-   `a`

```python
for start_index in range(0, len(text)):
	for end_index in range(len(text), start_index, -1):
		substr = text[start_index:end_index]
```

Next, check whether the string is a palindrome. If it is, check whether it's longer in length than the current longest palindrome we have found. If so, update the longest length.

```python
if is_palindrome(substr):
	substr_len = len(substr)
	if substr_len > longest_len:
		longest_len = substr_len
```

And finally, after all the loops have finished, print out the longest length found.

```python
print(longest_len)
```

And... that's it! Here is the code in its entirety:

> You can also see the code as a Python file [here](./code/ccc_2016_j3.py).

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    reversed_string = string[::-1]
    return string == reversed_string


text = input()
longest_len = 0


for start_index in range(0, len(text)):
    for end_index in range(len(text), start_index, -1):
        substr = text[start_index:end_index]
        if is_palindrome(substr):
            substr_len = len(substr)
            if len(substr) > longest_len:
                longest_len = substr_len

print(longest_len)

```

Let's check if it works using DMOJ:

Cool, looks like it's working!

**Summary**<br>
Once you understand what this question is asking, it's relatively simple - just two nested loops and some comparisons. The solution presented above is absolutely _not_ optimized - for example, doing some more clever calculation and adding some more conditions would have allowed us to perform less iterations and thus arrive at a more efficient solution. However, the code works, and is relatively simple to understand, which is what matters.
