# CCC 2018 J3 - Hidden Palindrome

> This question is part of the CCC 2018 Junior [problem set](https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2018/stage%201/juniorEF.pdf).

## Problem Description

You decide to go for a very long drive on a very straight road. Along this road are five cities. As
you travel, you record the distance between each pair of consecutive cities.

You would like to calculate a distance table that indicates the distance between any two of the cities
you have encountered.

## Input Specification

The first line contains 4 positive integers less than 1000, each representing the distances between
consecutive pairs of consecutive cities: specifically, the ith integer represents the distance between
city _i_ and city _i + 1_.

## Output Specification

The output should be 5 lines, with the _i_th line (1 <= \_i_ <= 5) containing the distance from city _i_ to cities 1, 2, ... 5 in order, separated by one space.

## Sample Input

```
3 10 12 5
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
0 3 13 25 30
3 0 10 22 27
13 10 0 12 17
25 22 12 0 5
30 27 17 5 0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input

The first line of output contains:

-   0, since the distance from city 1 to city 1 is 0;
-   3, since the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 3;
-   13, since the distance between city 1 and city 3 is 3 + 10 = 13;
-   25, since the distance between city 1 and city 4 is 3 + 10 + 12 = 25;
-   30, since the distance between city 1 and city 5 is 3 + 10 + 12 + 5 = 30.
